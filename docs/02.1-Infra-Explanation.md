### **1. NAT Gateway**
```hcl
nat_gateway = lookup(var.subnet_nat_gateway, subnet_name, false) && (!contains(keys(subnet_config), "nat_gateway") || subnet_config["nat_gateway"] == null) ? {
  id = var.enable_nat_gateway ? azurerm_nat_gateway.this[0].id : null
} : lookup(subnet_config, "nat_gateway", null)
```
- **Purpose**: Associates a NAT gateway with the subnet to provide outbound internet connectivity for resources within the subnet.
- **Details**:
  - `lookup(var.subnet_nat_gateway, subnet_name, false)`: Checks if a NAT gateway is enabled for the subnet in the `var.subnet_nat_gateway` variable.
  - `var.enable_nat_gateway`: Conditionally assigns the NAT gateway ID if NAT gateway is enabled globally.
  - `azurerm_nat_gateway.this[0].id`: Refers to the NAT gateway created earlier in the configuration.
  - If no NAT gateway is specified, it defaults to `null`.

### **2. Network Security Group (NSG)**

- **Purpose**: Associates an NSG with the subnet to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Details**:
  - `lookup(var.subnet_network_security_group, subnet_name, false)`: Checks if an NSG is enabled for the subnet in the `var.subnet_network_security_group` variable.
  - `azurerm_network_security_group.https.id`: Refers to the NSG created earlier in the configuration.
  - If no NSG is specified, it defaults to `null`.

### **3. Route Table**

- **Purpose**: Associates a route table with the subnet to define custom routing rules for traffic within the subnet.
- **Details**:
  - `lookup(var.subnet_route_table, subnet_name, false)`: Checks if a route table is enabled for the subnet in the `var.subnet_route_table` variable.
  - `azurerm_route_table.this.id`: Refers to the route table created earlier in the configuration.
  - If no route table is specified, it defaults to `null`.

### **4. Service Endpoints**
```hcl
service_endpoints = lookup(var.subnet_service_endpoints, subnet_name, null) != null && lookup(var.subnet_service_endpoints, subnet_name, []) != [] && (!contains(keys(subnet_config), "service_endpoints") || subnet_config["service_endpoints"] == null) ? lookup(var.subnet_service_endpoints, subnet_name, []) : lookup(subnet_config, "service_endpoints", null)
```
- **Purpose**: Enables service endpoints for the subnet to securely connect to Azure services (e.g., Azure Storage, Azure SQL) over the Azure backbone network.
- **Details**:
  - `lookup(var.subnet_service_endpoints, subnet_name, null)`: Checks if service endpoints are defined for the subnet in the `var.subnet_service_endpoints` variable.
  - If service endpoints are specified, they are applied to the subnet.
  - If no service endpoints are specified, it defaults to `null`.

### **5. Service Endpoint Policies**
```hcl
service_endpoint_policies = lookup(var.subnet_service_endpoint_policies, subnet_name, false) && (!contains(keys(subnet_config), "service_endpoint_policies") || subnet_config["service_endpoint_policies"] == null) ? {
  policy1 = {
    id = azurerm_subnet_service_endpoint_storage_policy.this.id
  }
} : lookup(subnet_config, "service_endpoint_policies", null)
```
- **Purpose**: Associates service endpoint policies with the subnet to restrict access to specific Azure services (e.g., Azure Storage).
- **Details**:
  - `lookup(var.subnet_service_endpoint_policies, subnet_name, false)`: Checks if service endpoint policies are enabled for the subnet in the `var.subnet_service_endpoint_policies` variable.
  - `azurerm_subnet_service_endpoint_storage_policy.this.id`: Refers to the service endpoint storage policy created earlier in the configuration.
  - If no service endpoint policies are specified, it defaults to `null`.

### **6. Delegation**
```hcl
delegation = lookup(var.subnet_delegations, subnet_name, []) != [] ? var.subnet_delegations[subnet_name] : lookup(subnet_config, "delegation", null)
```
- **Purpose**: Delegates the subnet to an Azure service (e.g., Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Databricks) to manage resources within the subnet.
- **Details**:
  - `lookup(var.subnet_delegations, subnet_name, [])`: Checks if delegations are defined for the subnet in the `var.subnet_delegations` variable.
  - If delegations are specified, they are applied to the subnet.
  - If no delegations are specified, it defaults to `null`.

---

### **7. Role Assignments**
```hcl
role_assignments = lookup(var.subnet_role_assignments, subnet_name, false) && (!contains(keys(subnet_config), "role_assignments") || subnet_config["role_assignments"] == null) ? {
  role1 = {
    principal_id               = azurerm_user_assigned_identity.this.principal_id
    role_definition_id_or_name = "Contributor"
  }
} : lookup(subnet_config, "role_assignments", null)
```
- **Purpose**: Assigns roles to the user-assigned identity for managing resources within the subnet.
- **Details**:
  - `lookup(var.subnet_role_assignments, subnet_name, false)`: Checks if role assignments are defined for the subnet in the `var.subnet_role_assignments` variable.
  - `azurerm_user_assigned_identity.this.principal_id`: Refers to the user-assigned identity created earlier in the configuration.
  - If no role assignments are specified, it defaults to `null`.

### **How It Works**
- The `subnets` block dynamically iterates over a map of subnets (`var.subnets`) and applies the specified configurations to each subnet.
- Each subnet can have unique configurations for NAT gateways, NSGs, route tables, service endpoints, delegations, and role assignments.
- The `lookup` function is used to check if a configuration is specified for a subnet. If not, it defaults to `null` or a predefined value.
